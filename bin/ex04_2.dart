  /*There is a point in the center of a rectangle with the width of 800 
    and the height of 600 pixels (or millimeters on paper). The north-west
    corner of the rectangle has zero coordinates (x = 0, y = 0). Positive x 
    numbers go towards the east of the rectangle. Positive y numbers go 
    towards the south of the rectangle.

    Draw a line on paper of the length of 160 pixels (millimeters)
    *from the center of the rectangle under the angle of 45 degrees  
    towards the south-east of the rectangle. This is only to help
    you calculate the following:

    Given the center of the rectangle as the starting point and
    the angle of 45 degrees, calculate the end point of the line.
